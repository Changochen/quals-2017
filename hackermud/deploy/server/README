Deploy instructions

Run in an infinite loop so that when it reboots (or possibly crashes) it auto restarts

Run with ./hackserver 3600

The server will automatically restart itself every hour in this mode

Please enable it so that it can generate a core dump so it is crashing I can review and possibly fix the server as the game is ongoing!
