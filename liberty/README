A client/server setup, the user gets the liberty binary only from the client folder

The server uses stdin/stdout while the client connects on port 11445 so run via xinetd or similar
The server folder must have the following from the server folder
	all .a files from kernel folder in a kernel folder
	all *.bin files from payloads and sub folders in a payloads folder and the appropriate sub folders
	flag file and compress.py

The server must be able to run python unless I modify the server to internally compress everything
The server must be able to run gcc 64bit mode

See setup-server.sh which should setup the proper structure and files

If you wish to build
cd client
make
cd ../kernel
./build.sh
cd ../server
make
