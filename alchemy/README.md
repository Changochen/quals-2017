# alchemy

part of the crackme2k project

alchemy is a challenge that asks players to solve a random set of simple
crystal-based crackmes from a set of a few hundred, which means it asks players
to write a simple CRS.

## Dependencies

`alchemy` ships with a `Dockerfile` that has been tested with Docker for Mac and
also just regular ol' docker on Ubuntu 16.04.
